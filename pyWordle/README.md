## Welcome to PyWordle - A Wordle Clone for your Terminal

This simple python program allows you to play a text based version of the popular word-guessing game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)
right from your terminal. It utilizes the Python Datamuse API to generate 5 letter words to guess within 6 turns. I whipped this up so I could sneak in a quick break from work without ever leaving my screen, giving my brain a breather for a few minutes.
